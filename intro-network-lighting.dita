  <p>Network light bulbs work with your light fixtures the same way as standard light bulbs. They
   are different, however, in a couple of ways:<ul id="ul-iq3-2wp-3r">
    <li>The lighting element in the light bulb uses energy-efficient LED technology.</li>
    <li>The light bulb includes wireless technology that allows the light bulb to connect to a
     network and be managed remotely.</li>
   </ul></p>
  <p>Because the light bulbs can be connected to a network, you have greater flexibility in how you
   use them.</p>
  <example>
   <title>Examples</title>
   <ul id="ul-o3m-dxf-jr">
    <li>You can program your lighting network so that when you press a button upon arriving home, an
     entryway and a hallway light turn on. </li>
    <li>When you go to bed, your remote control can turn off all lights on the network.</li>
   </ul>
